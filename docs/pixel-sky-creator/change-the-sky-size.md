# Change the sky's size

To change the sky's size:
- In the Hierarchy, click the `Sky` game object to select it
- In the Inspector, edit the `Width` and `Height` values in the `Dimensions (px)` section of the `Sky` game object's `Sky (Script)` component
- Click the Play button to see the changes reflected in the Scene and Game windows

:::caution
Do not change the sky's size by editing the `Sky` game object's `Transform` component and adjusting the `Scale` value. This will cause incorrect rendering. Instead, use the method mentioned above.
