# Change the sky's dither

Pixel Sky Creator ships with three pre-made dither patterns to choose from. These are saved in the asset's Sprites folder.

To change the sky's dither:
- In the Hierarchy, click the `Sky` game object to select it
- In the Inspector, click the circular icon on the right-hand side of the `Dither Texture` field in the `Sky` game object's `Sky (Script)` component. This will open the Select Texture2D window.
- Select the desired dither texture
- Click the Play button to see the changes reflected in the Scene and Game windows
