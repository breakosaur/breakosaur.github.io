# Change the sky's colors

To change the sky's colors:
- In the Hierarchy, click the `Sky` game object to select it
- In the Inspector, click the `Colors` gradient in the `Colors (bottom --> top)` section of the `Sky` game object's `Sky (Script)` component. This will open the Gradient Editor window.
- Change the gradient values as desired. Each gradient color equates to one color band in the sky. A maximum of eight color bands per gradient can be added.
- Click the Play button to see the changes reflected in the Scene and Game windows

A gradient can also be saved for use elsewhere (for example, in another sky) by creating a preset.
